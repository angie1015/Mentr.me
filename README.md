# Mentr.me

The recent COVID pandemic has disrupted many sectors, especially the educational and industrial sectors. The enormous number of layoffs due to COVID19 and difficulties faced by students due to the closing down of their institutes inspired us to do something about it

Mentr.me brings the two sectors together to better equip them for a competitive job market. With their verified credentials, now the ex-employees can upgrade their skills by mentoring students and in-turn get noticed by recruiters! Students get to work on hands-on projects under these skilled mentors to thrive in a competitive job market.

Mentors earn a small amount as a reward and gain points for helping out students with their projects. Top performers get to have a 1:1 virtual coffee chat with a recruiter.

Students can verify their skills by taking our assessments and earn scratchcards to win tickets to global conferences! Students are also encouraged to help out their peers and gain points to get referrals!

Recruiters get to network with potential candidates with proven skills as demonstrated by their mentorships.
